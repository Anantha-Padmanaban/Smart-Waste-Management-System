# Smart-Waste-Management-System
========================

One of the most significant issues created by the expanding urbanization is garbage management. Several steps make to an effective method for dealing with the waste management problem. To begin, we must consume things in a sensible manner in order to eliminate unnecessary waste. Following that, garbage disposal should be done in a systematic manner. Finally, garbage should be recycled to the greatest extent possible. Economic and environmental considerations should be taken into account when implementing these steps. 

Waste disposal has a large impact on both factors, and optimizing it can increase the positive effects greatly. Simultaneously, there is a clear requirement that recycling bins be emptied on a regular basis to ensure them clean. Meeting this condition is tough in a situation with thousands of recycling stations (each one with numerous containers) distributed across a large geographic area. 

A Smart Trash Management system that combines Internet of Things components is an enabling technology for tackling waste transportation optimization challenges. It will allow each recycling container to keep track of how full it is. The advanced ability of such a system will enable the forecast of a recycling container's estimated emptying time, i.e. whenever the bin container's filling level reaches a threshold value. By predicting fill levels, superfluous transportation can be avoided without violating the overfilling rule.
